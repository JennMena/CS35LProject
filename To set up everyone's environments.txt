TO SET UP EVERYONE'S ENVIRONMENT:

Install SQL Server and Management Studio on windows:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udp1lQe6SZ0

When you are prompted with "Authentication mode" during installation of SQL server select "Mixed"
Usuario default: sa
And use any password
If you didn't selected "Mixed" then you will access SQL Management Studio with your Windows Authentication

This is important because this are the credentials that you need to update to your own in Backend\src\config\database.js
This way the project will connect to your database

On SQL Server Configuration Manager:
Go to Network (last one) -> TCP/IP -> IP Address, then:
set Enabled to YES for:
127.0.0.1
::1

_______________________________________________________________________________
After SQL Management Studio is working you can create a "New Query" and paste the code in "budget_structure.sql" then execute it. This will create the database.


Install Node Version Manager (nvm-setup.exe), then run:
nvm install 16
nvm use 16 //Is to use the version 16 so that the project works
node --version //Should say 16

To install Nodemon:
(Nodemon watches your files, and if any file it is monitoring changes, it automatically restarts your application with the new changes)
Open a terminal on the project of Backend:
npm install -g nodemon
nodemon ./src/app.js
	- If it gives an error open the CMD as admin and run: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned


AFTER ABOVE, TO SET UP FRONT END PROJECT
Open the folder in VS and in a terminal run:
npm install
nodemon ./src/app.js

TO SET UP BACKEND PROJECT
Open the folder in VS in a terminal run:
npm install
npm start
